OpenCL Performance Prediction using Architecture-Independent Features
---------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the artefacts associated with the paper "OpenCL Performance Prediction using Architecture-Independent Features" published in the proceedings for The 2018 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS 2018) in the International Workshop on High Performance and Dynamic Reconfigurable Systems and Networks (DRSN-2018) and was presented in Orleans, France 16-20 July 2018.

Reproducibility
---------------

The model can be regenerated using the same set of tools on the provided data.

A reproduction of the model can be performed on the same sampled data as used in the published paper.
This is available as `data/full_dat.Rda`.

The model is regenerated by running `source('build_model.R')` from within `R`.
It can then be manipulated in `R` and is known as the `rgd.aiwc` variable.
Predictions can be made by adjusting the AIWC feature space, for instance of the test data set:

`x <- test_dat[1,] #make just one prediction by taking the first row of AIWC entries`

`x$device <- 'gtx1080' #change the AIWC feature space -- in this instance by changing the device from xeon_es-2697v2 to gtx1080`

`y <- predict(rgd.aiwc,type='response',data=x) #make a prediction`

`y$predictions #see the prediction for a CPU device`

Alternatively, generating a different sample the collected data is achieved by first by uncompressing the tarballs. The AIWC feature-spaces are extracted with:

`
cd data/feat_data/archive
python extract.py
`

The run-time data are extracted with:

`
cd data/time_data
tar -xvf all_times.tar
`

Finally, the data manipulations to bind the AIWC metrics -- predictor variables -- to the collected runtime results -- response variables -- and a sub-sampling is achieved by then launching `R`, in the `codes` directory, and executing the following R command:

`
cd codes
source(sample_generator.R')
`
